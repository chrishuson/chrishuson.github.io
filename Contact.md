## My Background

This is my first year at La Scuola d'Italia, but it will be my fourteenth year teaching high school mathematics. Previously, I had a 25-year career on Wall Street, applying mathematics and technology to trade and to solve my clients' problems. Today I believe education is ripe for the same kind of innovation we have seen transform other parts of society. I'm excited to be part of this important work, and I couldn't be happier to do it with great colleagues at La Scuola d'Italia and a wonderful group of students and their families.

I studied mathematics education at Teachers College, Columbia University, earning a Masters degree and a PhD. My dissertation investigated teaching students to apply mathematics in practical situations, "[Mathematical Modeling from the Teacher's Perspective](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D82N529Z)." My undergraduate degree is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Management Science.
