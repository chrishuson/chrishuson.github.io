# My Background
This will be my eleventh year teaching mathematics at BECA. Previously, I had a 25-year career on Wall Street, applying mathematics and technology to trade and solve my clients' problems. Today I believe education is ripe for the same kind of innovation we have seen transform other parts of society. I'm excited to be part of this important work, and I couldn't be happier to do it in the South Bronx with great colleagues at BECA and a wonderful group of students and their families. 

I studied mathematics education at Teachers College, Columbia University, earning a Masters degree and a PhD. My dissertation investigated teaching students to apply mathematics in practical situations, "Mathematical Modeling from the Teacher's Perspective." My undergraduate degree is from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Management Science.
