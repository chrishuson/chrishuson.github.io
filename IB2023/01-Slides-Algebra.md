## Lesson 1.1 Linear equations in context

### Solve the problem with the partner seated next to you
The class will be divided among the three problems.

1. In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has
    been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, how many miles
    of paved road will County X have in 2030?
1. In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has
    been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, if n is the number
    of years after 2014, which of the following functions f gives the number of miles
    of paved road there will be in County X?
    1. $f(n) = 8 + 783n$
    1. $f(n) = 2014 + 783n$
    1. $f(n) = 783 + 8n$
    1. $f(n) = 2014 + 8n$

1. In 2014, County X had 783 miles of paved roads. Starting in 2015, the county has
    been building 8 miles of new paved roads each year. At this rate, in which year will
    County X first have at least 1,000 miles of paved roads?
  (Assume that no paved roads go out of service.)

### As you complete the problem record the following:
1. Solve the problemâ€”show all work and answer the question.
1. What do you need to know in order to be able to solve this problem?
1. What is the process you used to solve this problem?

### What do you need to know to solve each problem?
Take class notes in a composition book
1. What a variable is, and how to define a variable.
1. How to write an expression.
1. How to substitute-in a value for a variable.
1. How to create a function for a given situation/context.
1. How to solve an equation/inequality.
1. How to interpret a solution.

### Create a list of steps for solving these types of problems.
1. Define one or more variables that represent quantities in the question.
1. Write one or more equations, expressions, inequalities, or functions that represent the relationships in the question.
1. Solve the equation, and interpret the solution in terms of what the question is asking.

### Solve the problem by yourself
4. To edit a manuscript, Miguel charges \$50 for the first 2 hours and \$20 per hour after the first 2 hours. Which of the following expresses the amount, $C$, in dollars, Miguel charges if it takes him $x$ hours to edit a manuscript, where $x>2$?  
    1. $C=20x$
    1. $C=20x+10$
    1. $C=20x+50$
    1. $C=20x+90$
