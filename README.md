Hosting for my math instruction website, Geometry, Precalculus, IB Math, and Career Financial Management courses.

(The url math.huson.com is redirected here) The official school course websites are hosted on BECA's Google Classroom.

Generally, my problem sets and slides are written in $\LaTeX$ and managed in my course-files GitHub repo. These pages are written in markdown.
