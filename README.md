Hosting for Course Files

*(for my high school math classes)*

Generally, these are policies and plans that apply to all of my classes and can be written in enhanced markdown. The documents are edited in stackedit.io and published here as html for web hosting. The source markdown files are backed up on my GitHub repository directory, course-files/stackedit/.
