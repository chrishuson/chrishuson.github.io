Scientists estimate that the Pacific Plate, one of Earthâ€™s tectonic plates, has moved about 1,060 kilometers in the past 10.3 million years. What was the average speed of the Pacific Plate during that time period, in _centimeters_ per year?

A. 1.03 $\hspace{2cm}$ C. 103
B. 10.3  $\hspace{2cm}$ D. 1,030
- $$\frac{1,060 \text{ km}}{10,300,000 \text{ years}} \times \frac{100,000 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ km}} = 10.291... \text{ cm/year}$$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

2. County Y consists of two districts. One district has an area of 30 square miles and a population density of 370 people per square mile, and the other district has an area of 50 square miles and a population density of 290 people per square mile. What is the population density, in people per square mile, for all of County Y?

3. A furniture store buys its furniture from a wholesaler. For a particular table, the store usually charges its cost from the wholesaler plus 75%. During a sale, the store charged the cost from the wholesaler plus 15%. If the sale price of the table was $299, what is the usual price for the table?

A. \$359  $\hspace{2cm}$ C. \$479 
B. \$455  $\hspace{2cm}$ D. \$524

- $P_{wholesale} \times 1.15 = \$299$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- $P=\$260$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- $(\$260) \times 1.75 = \$455$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

## Ratio and proportion example

- A fish farmer stocks her fish tanks with a ratio of 5 talapia to 3 trout. If she puts 300 talapia into the tanks, how many trout should she add?  

 - Model the problem 3 ways: a table, a proportion, and a ratio calculation with units  

> | talapia | trout |
> | ------- | ----- |
> | 5 | 3 |
> | 300 | ? | <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
 
- $\displaystyle \frac{5 \text{ talapia}}{3 \text{ trout}} = \frac{300 \text{ talapia}}{x \text{ trout}}$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- $$\hspace{3cm} 300 \text{ talapia} \times \frac{3 \text{ trout}}{5 \text{ talapia}} = $$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
