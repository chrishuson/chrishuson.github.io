## Ratio and proportion example

- A fish farmer stocks her fish tanks with a ratio of 5 talapia to 3 trout. If she puts 300 talapia into the tanks, how many trout should she add?  

 - Model the problem 3 ways: a table, a proportion, and a ratio calculation with units  

> | talapia | trout |
> | ------- | ----- |
> | 5 | 3 |
> | 300 | ? | <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
 
- $\displaystyle \frac{5 \text{ talapia}}{3 \text{ trout}} = \frac{300 \text{ talapia}}{x \text{ trout}}$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

- $$\hspace{3cm} 300 \text{ talapia} \times \frac{3 \text{ trout}}{5 \text{ talapia}} = $$ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

## Ratio and proportion example 2

Jack was planting a tree. He was to dig a hole that was 3 feet deep for every 5 feet of tree height. How deep should he dig the hole for a tree that is 17 feet high?

## Ratio and proportion example 3

A meteorologist reports that the ratio of snowfall in January to total snowfall during the average winter is 2 to 5. If 34 inches have fallen in January of the current year, find the predicted total snowfall for the entire winter.  

Model the problem in the most efficient way of your choice.
