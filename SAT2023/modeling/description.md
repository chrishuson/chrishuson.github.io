# Mathematical Modeling and Problem Solving

Mathematical Modeling and Problem Solving is a new elective course for students with a strong interest in mathematics. The course aims to help you develop your mathematical skills and knowledge, as well as your critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills. You will learn how to use various mathematical tools and methods to model, analyze, and solve problems in different contexts, such as science, engineering, business, and social issues.

Students across the grades will take the course together--multiple ages in one class--so that the younger students will benefit from the mature thinking of their older classmates and the upperclassmen will be challenged to communicate clearly. The course will have a hybrid or blended format, meaning that you will meet both in person and online (video conferences). 

The course content will cover topics such as linear and nonlinear functions, systems of equations and inequalities, optimization, probability, data analysis, and decision making. You will also explore some advanced topics such as calculus, matrices, graph theory, game theory, cryptography, and more. You will apply these topics to real-world problems such as designing a water slide, optimizing a production line, predicting an epidemic outbreak, encrypting a message, or voting in an election.

You will have to complete individual and group tasks that demonstrate your understanding of the course content and your ability to apply it to real-world situations. You will also have to present your work to your peers and the instructor.

The benefits of taking this course are many. You will not only improve your mathematical skills and knowledge, but also your problem-solving abilities. You will learn how to apply mathematics to various domains and disciplines that interest you or that you may pursue in the future. You will also have the opportunity to work with other hardworking students from different grades who share your passion for math.
