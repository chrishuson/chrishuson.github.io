# Common errors

## (self-?) Assess Algebra prior knowledge

- operating on fractions
- precision, rounding
- multistep substitution & calculator calculations
- algebraic notation
- modeling with algebra
- interpret $f(0) \text{ versus } f(x)=0$, graphically and in context
- distributing a negative times a negative, e.g. $-2(x-4)=$

1. there are two solutions to $x^2=9$
2. $-2(x+a) = -2x +2a$
3. $3^2=6$
4. Failing to check solution
5. dropping notation (leading “=“, skipping sq rt)
6. “fake” compass marks (drawn “x”s)

## Geometry

### Unit 1: Length and area

Mismarking isosceles triangles congruent sides (when non-upright)

## Graphing / statistics

Misconception: When do we connect points, when do we fit a straight line? (don’t need to go through origin). Make up two problems where points should be connected, two where a straight line should be fit

- fitting a line w low correlation
- chi-sq’d with less than 5 expected; 
- Calculator notation, e.g.“*” as multiply

## Pedagogy

Make a list of the 5 or 10 common mistakes that you see in class. Create a bonus quiz where students, on a blank piece of paper, recall all 10 mistakes from memory, explain and/or prove the wrongness in each, and demonstrate and check the right way to think about it. Another positive incentive: Tell them that regardless of the topic the class is on, at least 5% of every assessment will involve one of those 10 mistakes, so they have to keep studying them.
