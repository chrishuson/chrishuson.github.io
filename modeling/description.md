# Modeling & Applied Mathematics

Modeling and Applied Mathematics is a new elective course for students with a strong interest in mathematics. The course aims to help you develop mathematical skills and knowledge, as well as critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills. You will learn to use modern mathematical tools and methods to model, analyze, and solve problems in real-world contexts such as business, social issues, engineering, and the sciences.

The course will draw a small number of highly motivated students from each grade level. A nomination from your math teacher is required to apply. The mix of multiple ages in one class is intentional. Younger students will benefit from the mature thinking of their older classmates and the upperclassmen will be challenged to communicate clearly. The course will have a hybrid or blended format, meaning that you will meet both in person and online (video conferences).

The course content will cover topics such as linear and nonlinear functions, systems, optimization, probability and statistics, data analysis, and decision making. You will apply these topics to real-world problems such as income inequality, optimizing a production line, predicting an epidemic outbreak, encrypting a message, or voting in an election.

You will have to complete individual and group tasks that demonstrate your understanding of the course content and your ability to apply it to real-world situations. Many of the applications will employ computer calculations (employing tools professionals use). We will have outside speakers, and you will visit local businesses to view how professionals really operate.

This course is preparation for quantitative work in college and careers in both STEM fields (technology, engineering) and business. You will develop important skills and knowledge as well as experience working collaboratively to solve problems among a hardworking and diverse group of peers.
