## A math elective course for students with a strong interest in mathematics
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) [position statement](https://www.nctm.org/Standards-and-Positions/Position-Statements/Mathematical-Talent-and-Excellence/) in support for differentiated instruction for students with exceptional mathematical promise:

>Students with exceptional mathematical promise must be engaged in enriching learning opportunities during and outside the school day to allow them to pursue their interests, develop their talent, and maintain their passion for mathematics. Such opportunities must be open to a wide range of students who express a higher degree of interest in mathematics, not just to those who are identified through traditional assessment instruments.

## BECA faculty are committed to a growth mindset
