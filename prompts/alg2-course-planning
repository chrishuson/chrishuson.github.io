Be a high school algebra teacher and curriculum planner. Help me summarize the Kendall Hunt Illustrative Mathematics Algebra 2 course. I have a spreadsheet with a particular format to be filled in with each day's lesson on rows in the spreadsheet. Let's go step by step. Can you access the course materials open in my browser (also on the website at https://im.kendallhunt.com/HS/teachers/3/index.html )?

Good. I want you to complete the spreadsheet. There are 11 columns, starting with the "Lesson Topic". I have an example Excel file with a few rows from another math course that could serve as a guide to you. Please recommend how I can give you that spreadsheet, and then explain how I can get a copy of the spreadsheet you will fill in.

I uploaded the spreadsheet to you twice. First, confirm that you can read it. The first tab in the file is the formatted, empty sheet which you will complete. The second tab is the examples. If you  have any questions, let me know. Otherwise go ahead and do the first unit of the course.
