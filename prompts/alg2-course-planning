Be a high school algebra teacher and curriculum planner. Help me summarize the Kendall Hunt Illustrative Mathematics Algebra 2 course in an Excel spreadsheet with a particular format that I will give you. 

I will upload the beginnings of the spreadsheet for you to complete. There are 11 columns requiring information about each day's lesson. Each day's lesson is a row in the spreadsheet. The first tab in the file is the formatted, empty sheet which you will complete. The second tab contains examples from a different course as a guide for you. 

Let's go step by step. Fill in the first unit of the course now and give me a spreadsheet file to review.


Be a high school algebra teacher and curriculum planner. Help me summarize the Kendall Hunt Illustrative Mathematics Algebra 2 course in an Excel spreadsheet with a particular format. 

I will upload the beginnings of the spreadsheet for you to complete. There are 11 columns requiring information about each day's lesson. Each day's lesson is a row in the spreadsheet. The first tab in the file is the formatted, partially-complete sheet which you will complete. The second tab contains examples from a different course as a guide for you. 

I will upload a pdf file with the information for the first unit. You will need to enter the information into the spreadsheet. The first two pages of the pdf contains the standards for the units. These go in columns "E" and "F" in the spreadsheet. Later pages in the pdf cover each day's lesson. The "Learning Goals" provide the material for the spreadsheet column "D". 

Let's go step by step. Fill in columns "D", "E", and "F" for the first unit of the course now and give me a spreadsheet file to review.

So some rows will have two Lesson Goals in the same cell. In that case, separate the Lesson Goals by a line return in the spreadsheet cell. Preface the text of each Learning Goal with its number in the lesson surrounded by parentheses, for example, "(1) " and "(2) ". Now make the spreadsheet
