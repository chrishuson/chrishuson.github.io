## Standard conventions for mathematical notation
*Practice writing mathematics according to IB requirements, as per exam rubrics.*
- Use the formula sheet.
- Chose the appropriate formula (M1).\
     (you do not have to copy the formula)
- Substitute values correctly (A1).
- Solve, showing key steps (A1).\
     (skip routine algebra if you like)
- Write down the exact solution or copy the calculator display. An ellipsis (\ldots) indicates more digits (A1).
- Round to 3 significant digits (use $\approx$)(A1).

 Examples of key algebraic techniques
- Setting a quadratic function $=0$
- Converting an exponent to a log
- Reading a value from a graph
- When writing lists, you may write only the first two and the last terms. For example,
$\sum_{k=1}^5 3 \cdot 2.25^k =3 + 6.75+\ldots+76.8867\ldots$
$=135.99609\ldots \approx 136$
