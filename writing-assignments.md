# Writing assignments: Short paper ideas

## On the line, in or out?

Different sports' rules define the field of play to include or exclude the edge. Discuss particular sports and compare to mathematical ideas, for example the algebra notation $x \leq 2$ versus $x<2$ and the graphing notation of an open versus solid circle or a dashed versus solid line.

## Famous geometer biography

Please research an important geometer and write a short paper (one paragraph to one page).

You may chose your own topic. For ideas look up one of the following people:

- Euclid
- Descartes
- Pythagoras
- Archimedes
- Socrates
- Plato
- Aristotle
- Ptolemy

Pick a specific topic, like a theorem or idea they are famous for. Pictures and diagrams are good. Here are some example ideas:

- How was Archimedes killed?
- How did Socrates teach?
- Where did Pythagoras live?
- Who was Plato's teacher, and who was his student?
- Where did Euclid work and study?
- What did the Greeks wear for the original Olympics?

## Temperature unit systems

How do Celsius and Fahrenheit (and Kelvin) units compare? What is their history? What are the ``anchoring" points (e.g. the temperature water freezes) and what is the slope of the measure based on physically? How do you convert one measure to another algebraically? Compare them graphically.
