# Writing to learn prompts

- Explain and justify why exponents should be added when terms with the same base are multiplied (subtracted/divided).
- Demonstrate the distributive property of multiplication over addition by restating multiplication as repeated addition.
- Explain why exponential functions with bases less than one are decreasing (decay), and how that relates to having a negative coefficient in the exponent
- Explain why adding a positive value to x before applying a function moves the curve horizontally to the left, while adding a positive value to the function output (the y) moves the curve vertically upward.
- Explain why multiplying the input of a function by a negative (x's coefficient) reflects the curve horizontally across the y-axis, while whereas taking the inverse of the function output  (negative  applied to the y) flips the curve vertically across the x-axis.
- Why is the function $f(x)=abs(x)$ symmetric across the y-axis?
- Why does a polynomial function composed only of even powers of x look the same when the x inputs are multiplied by negative one? (i.e. it is invariant, that is $f(-x)=f(x)$

- Why does it reflect negatively on the whole group when a student is talking over another student who is addressing the whole class?
